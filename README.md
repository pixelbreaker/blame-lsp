# Blame LSP

A simple Git Blame Language Server for use in the Helix editor.

A tiny Language Server (LSP) that shows git blame info on hover:
Author — short hash — relative date (YYYY-MM-DD)

## Install & build

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm run build
pnpm link```

## Motivation
Pretty much the only thing I miss after moving away from the noisy environment in VSCode and Zed (How many AI popups do we need?) is Gitlens.
